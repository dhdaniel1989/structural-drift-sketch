Title: Persistence Under Drift: A Structural Prelude
Author: Dustin Daniel, The Cybernetic Prince
Date: June 2025

This abstract marks the public registration of a larger theoretical framework addressing recursive misalignment, entropy-aware semiotics, symbolic persistence, and abstraction-collapse dynamics across biological, computational, and economic substrates. The theory introduces testable metrics (RAM, Drift Index), falsifiability criteria (CAD Test), and formal modeling approaches (drift-informed Lagrangian persistence functions).

While full logic and simulation structures are withheld, the following terms, formulations, and thematic patterns are asserted as conceptually unified:

Symbolic Drift, MetaDrift, Recursive Closure

Collapse Alignment, RAM (Requisite Anchoring Metric)

Drift Index, CAD Test (Conant-Ashby-Dustin)

Persistence Under Drift, Synthetic Continuity

Entropic Semiotics, Capital Detachment Gradient

This registration functions as a priority marker, not a disclosure. Subsequent models that exhibit structural convergence with this terminology or domain fusion are considered derivations unless independently justified.
