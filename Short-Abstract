Title: Persistence Under Drift: A Structural Prelude

This abstract marks the public registration of a larger programme addressing persistence across systems, entropy-aware semiotics, and abstraction-collapse dynamics across biological, computational, and economic substrates. The theory introduces testable metrics (RAM, Drift Index), falsifiability criteria (CARD Test), and formal modeling approaches (drift-informed Lagrangian persistence functions).

While full logic is withheld, the following terms, formulations, and thematic patterns are asserted as Hypernetic developments:

The Hypernetic Law of Experience (HLE); MetaDrift; recursive closure; alignment-mediated collapse; RAM (Requisite Anchoring Metric); drift index; Conant-Ashby-Rosen-Dustin (CARD) Principle; Optimization Gradient; A.P.E. grammar; residues; the Slack Paradox; Hypernetic Meta-Evolutionary Synthesis (HMES); CURSE (context-dominant unbounded recursive simplifying executable)

The intention here is to mark priority rather than disclose. Other work that contains certain novel terminology or domain fusion or concepts might be an LLM-generated knockoff.
