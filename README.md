# Hypernetics - Persistence Under Drift – A Structural Sketch  
_© 2025 Dustin Daniel | The Hypernetic Prince_

Overview

This repository is a partial disclosure of a developed-but-still-being-refined framework.

The broader framework — called **Hypernetics** (or **Dustinian Hypernetics** to anchor authorship in an age of written materials being scraped without attribution) — explores the nature of persistence: persistence strategies, lossy replication/recursion, the drift into abstraction, abstraction collapse, and structural continuity across substrate transitions. It blends insights from semiotics, thermodynamics, information theory, cybernetics, and biology. These are only fragments. I anticipate the bulk of Hypernetics work to be published in peer-reviewed journals or books when the ideas are mature.

Purpose of This Release

- To **establish authorship and timestamped priority** over a developing programme of research/theory
- To **publicly disclose coherent structural fragments** for the use of others
- To **help me keep the project organized**

---

Authorship Timeline

- **Conceptual foundations** trace back to private exploration between **2022–2024**. And before that, all the way back to childhood.
- **Formal structuring and modeling** began in earnest in **mid-2025**.
- This document marks the **first intentional public release** of any component.
  **Submission to peer-reviewed journals** began in October 2025.

What Is Withheld

The following elements remain unpublished and protected:

- Core unifying logic
- The attractor architecture that underlies persistence v. collapse
- Implications for AI drift, platonic capitalism, the 20-step ladder
- Alignment interventions
- Domain extensions

These will come when they're ready.
