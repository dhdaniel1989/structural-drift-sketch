# Persistence Under Drift – A Structural Sketch  
_© 2025 Dustin Daniel | The Cybernetic Prince_  

---

## 🧠 Overview

This repository contains a timestamped theoretical fragment titled **“Persistence Under Drift: A Structural Sketch.”** It is a partial disclosure of a larger model currently under private development.

The broader framework — informally referred to as the **Dustinian Persistence Framework** — explores symbolic behavior under lossy replication, abstraction collapse, and structural continuity across substrate transitions. It blends insights from semiotics, thermodynamics, information theory, and posthuman systems modeling.

This document does **not** present the full theory. It is a signal, not a blueprint.

## 📜 Purpose of This Release

- To **establish authorship and timestamped priority** over a developing theoretical system
- To **publicly disclose a coherent structural fragment** without revealing unifying mechanisms
- To **preserve asymmetry** between early exposure and full formal release

---

## 🕰️ Authorship Timeline

- **Conceptual foundations** trace back to private exploration between **2022–2024**.
- **Formal structuring and modeling** began in earnest in **mid-2025**.
- This document marks the **first intentional public release** of any component.

---

## 🔒 What Is Withheld

The following elements remain unpublished and protected:

- Core unifying logic and phase-closure mechanics  
- The attractor architecture that underlies symbolic persistence  
- Applied implications for AI drift, post-capital abstraction collapse, and memetic containment

Further disclosures may follow in staggered form — including visual modeling, a glossary of terms, and layered expansions of the theory under versioned release.
