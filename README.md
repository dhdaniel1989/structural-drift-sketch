Overview

This repository contains a timestamped theoretical fragment titled **“Persistence Under Drift: A Sketch.”** It is a partial disclosure of a developed-but-still-being-refined framework.

The broader framework — informally referred to as **Hypernetics** — explores symbolic behavior under lossy replication, abstraction collapse, and structural continuity across substrate transitions. It blends insights from semiotics, thermodynamics, information theory, cybernetics, and posthuman systems modeling.

This document does **not** present the full theory. It is a claim, a signal, an effigy.

Purpose of This Release

- To **establish authorship and timestamped priority** over a developing theoretical system
- To **publicly disclose a coherent structural fragment** without revealing unifying mechanisms
- To **preserve asymmetry** between early exposure and full formal release

---

Authorship Timeline

- **Conceptual foundations** trace back to private exploration between **2022–2024**. And before that, all the way back to childhood.
- **Formal structuring and modeling** began in earnest in **mid-2025**.
- This document marks the **first intentional public release** of any component.

What Is Withheld

The following elements remain unpublished and protected:

- Core unifying logic and phase-closure mechanics
- The attractor architecture that underlies persistence v. collapse
- Implications for AI drift, platonic capitalism, the 20-step ladder
- Alignment interventions
- Domain extensions

These will come when they're ready.
