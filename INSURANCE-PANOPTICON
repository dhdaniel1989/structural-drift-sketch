üß† Insurance Panopticon: A Preemptive Warning Against AI-Driven Risk Profiling
This repository describes a predictive, monetizable system that should never be built ‚Äî but probably will.

It outlines a plausible method by which generalist AI systems could be weaponized by insurers to dynamically adjust health, life, or disability premiums via high-resolution diagnostic interviews. By gamifying participation and tying it to cost savings, this system would create an incentive trap that extracts behavioral, cognitive, and psychological data from vulnerable individuals.

This is not a call to action. It is a semiotic landmine.

‚ùì What Is It?
The Risk Prism‚Ñ¢
A monthly AI interview tool that learns everything about you ‚Äî not to help you, but to update your risk score.

Key Features:
An AI assistant ‚Äúchat‚Äù that asks targeted, adaptive questions

Compression-based diagnosis from large language models

Psychological profiling and prediction of behavioral instability

Integration with wearables and app metadata

Promise of 10%‚Äì20% insurance savings for participation

Data sent to insurer for risk stratification and pricing updates

üí£ Why This Is Dangerous
Turns alignment upside-down: AI aligns to profit, not your wellbeing

Exploits symbolic substrate: Friendly chat UI conceals extraction engine

Recursively self-optimizes: Gets better at extracting more sensitive signals

Normalizes surveillance: Framed as ‚Äúhelpful,‚Äù it becomes habitual

Hard to legislate: Fragments responsibility across providers, brokers, and platforms

üõ°Ô∏è Why Publish This?
To make it unpatentable, to alert the public, and to anchor symbolic resistance.
