Purpose
This document outlines and claims a series of concepts, terms, and theoretical primitives associated with a broader research programme under private development since 2022 with insights that predate that significantly. The purpose for this document now is conceptual anchoring: a public timestamp of terminology and thematic scope for future reference.

The Hypernetics programme is focused on the the concept of "persistence". Why do some things persist and others don't? What are the mechanisms or "strategies" that are used to make persistence more robust or likely? Its primary influences are: classical cybernetics (esp. Ashby), semiotics (esp. Baudrillard and Peirce), biology (esp. Darwin), and economics. Hypernetics intends to be a true cross-domain discipline with an agnostic cross-domain spine and applied versions in each scientific discipline.

Hypernetics spans overlapping domains:
- systems under entropic and feedback pressure, with a focus on recursive systems. This includes but is not limited to: quantum physics; conventional physics; metaphysics/philosophy; astronomy; chemistry; biology (all of it, including: origin-of-life, meta-evolution, evolution/selection at various levels, human-oriented biology); medicine; meta-science (understanding the scientific process); culture; language; semiotic/symbolic systems of all kinds; social media; technology; economics (including heterodox/thermodynamic approaches); AI/AI alignment; game theory

Really, *any persistent system that exists long enough to be observed* falls under the umbrella of hypernetics in some way, since the central question is "why do some things persist and others don't?" Systems have more in common than it seems.

This artifact serves as a public signal and not a full release.
Structural logic, mathematical formalism, and simulation protocols remain proprietary and unpublished/under-review for publication in scientific journals or other venues.

Terms and Concepts
Below is a non-exhaustive list of terms, phrases, and concept groupings developed within the broader framework. They are not defined here, only declared. Any reuse of these terms in structurally similar domains that are not sourced from existing material should cite Hypernetic work -- this repo or articles when they are through peer review.

Terms and concepts are likely to be revised as the framework continues to be refined.

Thematic Domains:
- Recurring strategies used across domains
- Systems that persist by replicating symbols that detach from substrate
- Recursive feedback loops where compression replaces comprehension
- AI architectures that drift from human alignment via self-training artifacts
- Capital and data systems that select for abstraction over true reference
- Collapse scenarios where signal consistency masquerades as stability
- AI alignment as one version of a universal pattern

Status
This document is not a release of a unified theory. Its purpose is to:

- Publicly register conceptual terrain; the foundational ideas here were formalized in June 2025, though they existed conceptually before that time.
- Prevent unintentional or unattributed derivative work.
- Further documentation will follow at my discretion.
