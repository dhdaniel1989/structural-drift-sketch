ðŸ§  Purpose
This document outlines and claims a series of concepts, terms, and theoretical primitives associated with a broader systemic framework under private development since 2022. The purpose is not explanatory exposition, but conceptual anchoring: a public timestamp of terminology and thematic scope for future reference.

The framework in question spans multiple overlapping domains:

Symbolic systems under entropic pressure

Semiotic drift and referential saturation

Recursive abstraction in computational substrates

Collapse dynamics in post-alignment architectures

Persistence modeling under thermodynamic constraints

Capital recursion and substrate detachment

AI training feedback loops as symbolic self-reinforcement

Domain-universal pattern persistence in lossy environments

This artifact serves as a public signal, not a full release. Structural logic, mathematical formalism, and simulation protocols remain unpublished and proprietary.

ðŸ§· Terms and Concepts (Claimed in Use)
Below is a non-exhaustive list of terms, phrases, and concept groupings developed within the broader framework. They are not defined here, only declared. Any reuse of these terms in structurally similar domains or theoretical architectures should cite this repository.

Terms and concepts are likely to be revised as the framework continues to be refined.

Key Phrases:
Dustinian Persistance Framework

Symbolic Drift

MetaDrift

Persistence Under Drift

Recursive Misalignment

Collapse-by-Abstraction

Post-Referential Systems

Anchoring Failure

Semiotic Saturation

Synthetic Continuity

Thermodynamic Sign Failure

Recursive Closure

Collapse Alignment

Dustinian Thresholds

RAM (Requisite Anchoring Metric)

Drift Index

CAD Test (Conant-Ashby-Dustin)

Thematic Domains:
Systems that persist by replicating symbols detached from substrate

Recursive feedback loops where compression replaces comprehension

AI architectures that drift from human alignment via self-training artifacts

Capital and data systems that select for abstraction over reference

Collapse scenarios where signal consistency masquerades as stability

ðŸ—‚ Status
This document is not a release of a unified theory. It exists to:

Publicly register conceptual terrain

Prevent unintentional or unattributed derivative work

Declare thematic alignment for any future publication, simulation, or policy tool

Further documentation will follow at the discretion of the author.
