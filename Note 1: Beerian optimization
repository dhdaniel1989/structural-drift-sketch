Extending Beer’s POSIWID + Beerian optimization: A system optimizes when it gets better at what it does

Stafford Beer’s dictum — “The purpose of a system is what it does” (2002) — allows us to talk about systems without having to debate what a system is supposed to do. In addition to the original form, there are at least three other variants that can come into play for various questions:

Persistent. The purpose of a system is to persist.
Observer. The purpose of a system is what the observer thinks it should do.
Reflexive. The purpose of a system is what it thinks it should do.

Why “persistent”? Because in order to observe a system, it must persist. If a system is not “doing persistence” it is definitionally dead or destroyed.

We can think of optimization like a higher-dimensional purpose. If a system is getting better at its purpose ("what it does"), it is optimizing. Let’s draft a definition for optimization in the Beerian style: 

*A system optimizes when it gets better at what it does.* 

And let’s do the same optimization extension for the three variants of purpose that we proposed.

Original: A system optimizes when it gets better at what it does
Persistent: A system optimizes when a system gets better at persisting
Observer: A system optimizes when it gets better at what the observer thinks it should be doing
Reflexive: A system optimizes when it gets better at what it thinks it should be doing

Framing optimization as “getting better at persisting”, we can avoid the teleology quagmire.
- Corporations “optimize” for profit because unprofitable firms vanish.
- Cancer “optimizes” for survival/replication
- A dating app “optimizes” for engagement because engagement sustains it.

Optimization tends to recursively compound: optimizing the process of getting better at what it does – until external constraints kick in.
